### CS 4485 Spring 2024 - UTD CS Project
# ‘SocialPlay: Workout Challenge’

**Members**: Andrew Choi, Hoang Nguyen, Jeongsik Park, Jihyung Park, Het Patel, Santana Lopez


### Project Description
This project aims to revolutionize social media fitness challenges by integrating advanced body-tracking algorithms and dynamic gameplay mechanics.
Users can select specific body parts such as head, shoulders, elbows, knees, and feet, tailored to their chosen workout. The platform introduces a dynamic gaming element with randomly generated pipes, requiring users to maneuver a bird attached to their selected body part to dodge obstacles and score points. A leaderboard tracks user scores, fostering healthy competition, while recordings of gameplay can be effortlessly shared on social media platforms, amplifying user engagement and recognition. This innovative approach not only promotes physical activity but also provides valuable data insights for brands and organizations to customize future challenges. SocialPlay redefines fitness challenges by offering an immersive, gamified experience that motivates, connects, and rewards users for their commitment to self-improvement.
